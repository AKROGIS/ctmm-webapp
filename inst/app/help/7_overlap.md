### Overlap of Home Ranges
- Home range Overlap are calculated based on selected models in `Model Selection` page.
- When multiple models for same individual are selected and compared, `animal name - model type` will be used as identifier. Otherwise just `animal name` is used.
- By default all meaningful combinations (v1 v2 are always sorted in alphabeta order, since the order doesn't matter) are calculated and sorted by the highest value.
- You can sort the table by name, value, or filter the table with search keywords. The `Value Range` plot will update accordingly and always in same order.
- Clicking on rows will highlight the corresponding part in `Value Range` plot.

### Location Plot
- By default an overview of all individuals involved are shown.
- If some rows in table are selected, every selected pair is plotted individually.
- The plot order also match the order of selected rows in table, and respond to the filtering in table.
