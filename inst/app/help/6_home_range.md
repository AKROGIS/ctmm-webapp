- Home ranges are caculated for the selected models in model selection table. All home ranges are calculated in same grid so it's easier to calculate overlaps afterwards.
- See `level.UD` in [ctmm::plot.telemetry](https://ctmm-initiative.github.io/ctmm/reference/plot.telemetry.html) for details of `Home Range Contours`.
- You can input a series of comma separated values like `20, 50, 95`. 
- Home range can be exported to shapefile or raster format. See help inside the export dialog.
