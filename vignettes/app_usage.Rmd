## Introduction

This document demonstrates the usage of the web app.

### Common features across pages
  - The green help button in each page/box provides help, notes and references. The yellow action button make changes to data.
  - In many tables, row selection can trigger changes in linked view. In the data summary table 1 in `Visualization` page, selected rows (if no rows are selected, all rows in current page) determine the `current subset`, which is the focused data through the app. Note if you are selecting multiple rows, each click may trigger a change, because the app have no way to know if that click is the final selection or just part of a multi selection.
  - You can click table header to sort, input keyword to search and filter, and linked view often can be updated too.
  - The app try to maintain a consistent color theme from beginning to end. Each animal will have a distinct and consistent color in most tables and plots. The model summary table rows are colored by model type, and the home range polygons are colored by each different model.
  - Most scatter plots can be zoomed in by drawing a box in plot, then double click to zoom to that box. Double click in the plot will quit the zoom.
  - The app will record every meaningful data changes in the console, and the report can be saved, so that the whole analysis can be reproduced easily.
