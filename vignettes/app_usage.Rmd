## Introduction

This document demonstrates the usage of the web app. 

### Common features across pages
  - The green help button in each page/box provides help, notes and references. This document will only provide a high level overview for the big picture, leave the details in the help buttons.
  - For tables
    - You can click table header to sort, input keyword to search and filter, and linked view often can be updated too.
    - Row selection often can trigger changes in linked view. In the data summary table 1 in `Visualization` page, selected rows (if no rows are selected, all rows in current page) determine the `current subset`, which is the focused data through the app. Note if you are selecting multiple rows, each click may trigger a change, because the app have no way to know if that click is the final selection or just part of a multi selection.
  - Most scatter plots can be zoomed in by drawing a box in plot, then double click to zoom to that box. Double click in the plot will quit the zoom.
  - The app try to maintain a consistent color theme from beginning to end, in tables and plots. Each animal will have a distinct and consistent color. The model summary table rows are colored by model type, and the home range polygons are colored by each different model.
  
## App structure  
*whole app with arrows to each section* top right, side bar, app options
- The app will record every meaningful data changes in a log, and later compile to a work report when requested. The log entries and warning/error messages will show up in the R console if available. If you are running the app from a hosted server, clicking `Download Report` button will download the report. `Save Progress` button in side bar will save the report, plots, tables and data into a zip, so that the whole analysis can be reproduced easily.

*console message*
Each page represent a stage in the workflow.
  
### Import Data

Data can be loaded to app through
1. ctmm package internal datasets, with option to take a small sample for exploring app purpose (the model fitting will be much quicker)
2. upload Movebank Format file
3. upload previous saved progress zip
4. download from Movebank and import to app directly
5. start app with `ctmmweb::app(data)` using data parameter in R console

### Visualization

- selected rows or current page determine the `current subset`.

*also update screen shot used in help page*

  Note the color theme is consistent across tables and plots.
