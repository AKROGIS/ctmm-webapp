## Installation

1. Install R

    Download R installer([win](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/3.5.2/R-3.5.2-win.exe), [mac](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-3.5.2.pkg), [Linux](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/)) and install R.

    *[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) is recommended but not a must.*

2. Start R

    Start `R console` from start menu (or RStudio if installed). All code below will run inside it.

3. Install app

    ```r
    install.packages("ctmmweb", 
                     repos = c(getOption("repos"),
                               "https://ctmm-initiative.github.io/ctmm_repo/"))
    
    ```

    For latest beta version:

    ```r
    if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("ctmm-initiative/ctmmweb")
    ```

4. Run app

    ```r
    ctmmweb::app()
    ```

## FAQ

- If you met errors in install/upgrade lots of packages, restart R session and install again often can solve the problem. 
- The app is started with default browser. Chrome is recommended as some other browsers have known limitations.

### Linux
- Following instructions [here for installing R](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/) (assuming Ubuntu or Linux Mint). Make sure to install `r-base-dev` too.
- RStudio have installer for Linux.
- Some of the packages needed for the app need extra steps to install properly:
  + `devtools` need `libcurl`, `ssl` if it's not already installed in your system. You can watch error messages to check what is required. I installed them in Linux Mint 18 with
  
        sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
        sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
  
  + `ctmm` need `rgdal`, which need another two libraries in linux:
  
        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev libproj-dev
