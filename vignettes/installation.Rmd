## Package installation

If you met errors in install/upgrade lots of packages, restart R session and install again often can solve the problem. 

If some dependency packages were installed before by `devtools::install_github`, `devtools` will always install the github source version even `ctmmweb` only need the CRAN binary version. Sometimes the source version need compilation which is time consuming or even can cause installation failures. Try to remove these package first so that only CRAN version will be installed.

### Windows

Some packages need to be built from source, and you need to install RTools in windows. Just follow the instructions when prompted.

### Linux
- Following instructions [here for installing R](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/) (assuming Ubuntu or Linux Mint). Make sure to install `r-base-dev` too.
- RStudio have installer for Linux.
- Some of the packages needed for the app need extra steps to install properly:
  + `devtools` need `libcurl`, `ssl` if it's not already installed in your system. You can watch error messages to check what is required. I installed them in Linux Mint 18 with
  
        sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
        sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
  
  + `ctmm` need `rgdal`, which need another two libraries in linux:
  
        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev libproj-dev
  
## Known limitations
- The app is started with default browser. Chrome is recommended as some other browsers have known limitations.
