## Introduction
- how to use package functions in analysis.
- Since most functions belong to a workflow, it's easier to put all functions usage examples in a workflow example than giving individual code examples in function help.
- test code, write document individually, but not to knit document in building site until final version.
- compare the ctmm vignette

```{r libraries and data, eval=TRUE}
library(ctmm)
library(ctmmweb)
data(buffalo)
```

- To plot multiple animals location with `ggplot2`, we need to merge all location data into a single `data.frame`. `merge_tele` will merge ctmm telemetry object/list into a list of location `data.table` and information `data.table`. `data.table` is compatible with `data.frame` but with much better performance.


```{r basic data structure}
# basic data structure
merged_data <- merge_tele(buffalo)
# a list of locations data.table/data.frame and information table
head(merged_data)
dt <- merged_data$data
info <- merged_data$info
```



basic intro on data structure

## Visualization
- The location `data.table` `dt` have `identity` column which is character vectors of animal names. `id` column are factorized names. In app we can select a subset of full data by slecting rows in the data summary table 1.

    ![](pic/01_summary_table.png)



```{r plot location and time, eval=TRUE}
# how to take subset, this is to simulate the row selection in app
# select by identity column
selected_dt <- dt[identity %in% c("Gabs", "Queen")]
# select by id factor column value
dt[as.numeric(id) %in% c(1, 3)]

# plot
plot_loc(selected_dt, dt)
plot_loc_facet(selected_dt)
plot_time(selected_dt)
# take the ggplot2 object to further customize it
plot_loc(selected_dt, dt) +
  ggplot2::ggtitle("Locations of Buffalos") +
  # override the default left alignment of title and make it bigger
  ctmmweb:::CENTER_TITLE
# export plot
g <- plot_loc(selected_dt, dt)
# it's commented out to avoid the file generation in folder
# ggplot2::ggsave("test.png", g)
```

## model summary table

```{r model summary, eval=FALSE}
sample_tele(buffalo[[1]], 100)
data_sample <- sample_tele_list(buffalo, 100)
model_fit_res <- par_fit_tele(data_sample)
summary_model_fit(model_fit_res)

# need to prepare model list dt like in app.
```

- generate proper dt with model list column, or just the model list with names? which should be enough for command line usage.
- select models, use the model summary table for selection, model number?
- check the parameter needed for following code

## variogram, home range, occurrence

```{r variogram, eval=FALSE}

```

```{r home range}

```

- with 100 sample, the Gabs 2nd model, OUF ani have error in occurrence plot? report this with reproducible code, also test with different sample size.
```{r occurrence}

```

## map

```{r point map, eval=TRUE}
# this is needed for using pipe operator
library(leaflet)
point_map(selected_dt, dt)
# add control. This is not a part of point_map function because we can only add control once and after all layers are added. If we want to overlay home range over points, we need to add control after home range layer are added.
point_map(selected_dt, dt) %>% 
  add_control(get_names(selected_dt))

# save map to html

```

- to add home range, there is no wrapped less parameter version because we need lots of information and need some flexibility (base map, controls have to be added later). It's actually easier to use the app to add home range, since it involves model selection, color assignment etc
- need to export add_home_range_list, maybe put names to range_list names.
```{r home range map, eval=FALSE}
base_map() %>% 
  add_home_range_list(hrange_list, hr_levels, hr_color_vec) %>% 
  add_control(model_names)

point_map(selected_dt, dt) %>% 
  add_home_range_list(hrange_list, hr_levels, hr_color_vec) %>% 
  add_control(c(get_names(selected_dt), model_names))

# save to html

```

## Other utility functions
code example for each function since we didn't put code example in help.
- disctance, speed outlier

### generic parallel function usage
```{r parallel, eval=FALSE}
# generic parallel usage
```
