# Movebank data download

1. In all Movebank studies, only a part of them have data visible to your account, which are labeled with `i_can_see_data`. Only these studies are listed in table `Movebank Studies`.
2. Not all studies have a valid number in `deployments`, `events` or `individuals`, that doesn't mean there is no data for download, just these information are not reported in the studies table.
3. There is no way to predict whether a study have data to download.

The error page said you can download the data once agreed to the license terms, however there are several possible cases:\n1. You need to agree the license terms before downloading. Go to www.movebank.org and search by movebank ID, try downloading there. \n2. Some data are not in Movebank but in other database. \n3. Some study page simply report 'No data are available for download.' without explanations."
