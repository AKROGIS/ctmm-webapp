### Current subset of individuals
All plots and actions are based on **current subset of individuals**.

- You can select rows in table `1. Individuals` by 
  - mouse clicking
  - `Select All` and `Clear Selection` buttons
- If no rows are selected, the individuals in current page are current subset.
- `Time subsetting` feature only work with single individual.

### Individuals table
- The color of rows match the colors in other plots. You can 
    - customize rows per page
    - use the search box to filter by name
    - sort the rows by column
    - switch time unit into seconds

### Plots
Select more individuals can show them all at once, select less individuals can show more details.
- `2. Overview` plot showed individual relative locations. 
  - When you selected some rows in `1. Individuals` table, the individuals selected are colored with matching colors, and the individuals in current page are shown in gray as background, which can also be turned off. 
- `3. Facet` draw each individual separately which avoided the overlap. It's easy to compare patterns because X axes are aligned, and all scales are same.
- `4. Individual` render individuals separately, centered by each, and still in same scale. The zoom slider will zoom into the center portion of all plots at the same time. This can exclude the outlier points in view quickly.
- For all independent scatter plot (except facet or other grouped plot) in app (like plot 2 in this page), you can draw a rectangle with mouse button pressed, then double click inside the rectangle to **zoom in**. Double click in plot reset the zoom in.
