- `Generate Report` will compile current recordings into a html report. 
  - The html will be opened in a new browser window if the app is running locally and the browser is configured correctly in R setup.
  - If the app is running in hosted server, you have to save the html file locally then open it.
- You can download report and other saved files as a zip with `Download All` button.
- Note the shinyapps.io server probably have a different timezone from your local time, so the timestamp inside report and the file names could have different time.
