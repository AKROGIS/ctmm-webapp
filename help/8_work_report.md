- The recording for report can be turned off in `Local Data Import` box of `Import Data` page.
- `Generate Report` will compile current recordings into a html report. 
  - The html will be opened in a new browser window if the app is running locally and the browser is configured correctly in R setup.
  - If the app is running in hosted server, you have to download the html file then open it.
- You can download report file itself, or with other saved files as a zip.
- Note the shinyapps.io server probably have a different timezone from your local time, so the timestamp inside report and the file names could have different time.
