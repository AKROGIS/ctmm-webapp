\title{Generate merged location and info \code{data.table} from telemetry object/list}
\usage{
merge_animals(tele_obj_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{tele_obj_list}{telemetry object/list}
}
\value{
list of
\itemize{
\item \code{data}: all animals merged in one data.table
\item \code{info}:
animal information table
}
}
\description{
A Telemetry list hold mutiple animal data in separate list items, each item
have the animal location data in a data frame, and other information in
various slots. This structure supports flexible S3 methods for telemetry
object. However to plot multiple animals location together with \code{ggplot2}
it's better to merge all location data into single data frame with an animal
id column.
}
\details{
We chose this data structure to be the main structure and made the app to
work on a set of animals at the same time in all steps. Thus any input
telemetry object/List need to be merged into a \code{data.table} of location data,
and another information \code{data.table} for animals. \code{data.table} is chosen over
\code{data.frame} for much better performance.
