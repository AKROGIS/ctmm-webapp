\title{Calculate speed for each animal location}
\usage{
calculate_speed(animals_dt, device_error = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{animals_dt}{telemetry data in merged data.table}

\item{device_error}{device error if available}
}
\value{
data.table with speed columns added.
}
\description{
It's difficult to get a simple speed definition yet robust to all kinds of
dirty data cases. A sophisticated method is attempt first which should cover
most common edge cases reasonably well. When it fails for extreme situations,
the function will fall back to simpler method which is more naive but robust.
}
\details{
To reduce duplicate calculation, speed calculation will use some columns
created in distance calculation. Always update \code{data.table} with \code{calculate_distance} first then use \code{\link[=calculate_speed]{calculate_speed()}}.
